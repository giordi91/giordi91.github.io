In today's blog post I would like to talk about hair simulation, it has been something that always piqued my interest. I attempted to do a proper simulation in the past, and got stuck in doing a stiffness constraint. Recently I picked it up again, this time following the AMD paper on hair simulation.
After going through the paper I was surprised on how close to an actual working solution I got, more on that later.
Here below the final result, a simulation of a single hair with quite high stiffness.

As you might have understoon from the gif we are going to write this in unity, the first pass is going to be in C# on the cpu, simulating a single hair.

The way I approached it was with a simple monobehaviour that exposes pretty much everything needed by the simulation, from positions and masses. Evaluation happens
in the Update method, although not ideal the correct time delta is used, vsync is also turned on which led to smooth 60fps.
