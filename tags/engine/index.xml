      <description>A different, hopefully better, approach to game engine resource management 
Intro Over the years I started shifting my game engine resource management to a different paradigm rather than the usual OOP. Such a paradigm is composed of a manager plus resource handles. I have used this system in many personal projects to great success. I hope it can be useful to other people and hope to hear different ways people handle their resources too!</description>

      <description>Planning the architecture for my first game engine resource compiler 
The ugly model loader If you are not interested in how I ended up with a crappy model loader, jump to the resource compiler section.
Since I started working with OpenGL, almost five years ago, I wrote a super simple and ugly model obj loader. The main issue was that tinyobj loader would give me back multiple index buffers, one per geometry attribute.</description>
